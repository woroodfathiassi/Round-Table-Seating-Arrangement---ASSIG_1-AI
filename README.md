# Optimizing Round Table Seating with Search Algorithms
---
This project explores the application of search algorithms to the problem of arranging guests around a round table. The goal is to minimize conflicts by placing individuals who dislike each other the least adjacent to one another.

Three search algorithms were implemented and compared: **Greedy**, **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)**, and **A***. The results of these algorithms, along with their performance analysis, are detailed in the accompanying report.
